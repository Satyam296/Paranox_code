FAILURE CASE ANALYSIS
======================================================================

Common Issues to Consider:

1. OCCLUSION
   - Objects partially hidden by other objects
   - Solution: Add more occluded examples to training data

2. LIGHTING CONDITIONS
   - Poor performance in very dark or very light conditions
   - Solution: Enhance lighting augmentation, add more varied lighting

3. OBJECT SIZE
   - Small or distant objects are harder to detect
   - Solution: Use multi-scale training, adjust anchor boxes

4. CLASS CONFUSION
   - Similar-looking objects misclassified
   - Solution: Add more diverse examples, focus on distinctive features

5. OBJECT OVERLAP
   - Multiple objects of same class close together
   - Solution: Adjust NMS threshold, improve bounding box precision

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Increase training epochs
- Try a larger model (e.g., yolov8m or yolov8l)
- Adjust data augmentation parameters
- Collect more training data using Falcon
- Fine-tune confidence and IoU thresholds
